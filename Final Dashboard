#Cart Abandonment Analysis

## Goal: 
Analyze the e-commerce purchase funnel(product view -> add to cart -> begin checkout -> complete purchase) to find where customers drop-off, which segments are most affected, and recoomend fixes that reduce lost revenue.

##Scope:
Session-level + event - level analysis using transaction/session logs. 
Focus dimensions: product category, region, device, traffic source, time(hour/day), and customer type (new vs returning).

##Problem Statement:
The business needs to understand when, who, and why users abandon carts so product, UX and marketing teams can reduce abandonment and recover revenue.

##Key Questions:
-At which funnel step is drop-off largest?
-Which product categories, devices, or regions have unusually high abandonment?
-Do time of day, session length or discounts affect abandonment?
-Which segments are high-value but highly-abandoned (worth targeted recovery)?
